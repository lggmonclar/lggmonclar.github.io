Hi! Welcome to my webpage.

My name is Luiz Gustavo Gomes Monclar, although most people usually just call me Luiz. I started learning programming in 2010 when I got into university at my home city of Curitiba, Brazil. 

Since December 2019, I've been living in Montréal, Canada and working during the day with really awesome people at <a href="https://www.square-enix-montreal.com/">Square Enix Montréal</a>, but every now and then I work on projects that are interesting to me outside of work. And those are usually what my blog posts are about.

My most recent project is an ever ongoing game engine built on C++, which you can check at <a href="https://github.com/lggmonclar/GRUT">https://github.com/lggmonclar/GRUT</a>
