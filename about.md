Hi! Welcome to my webpage.

My name is Luiz Gustavo Gomes Monclar, although most people usually just call me Luiz. I started learning programming in 2010 when I got into university at my home city of Curitiba, Brazil. 

As many people do, I started by developing games for school projects, but drifted a bit away from that path once I graduated. However, the more I worked with back and front-end development for apps and websites, the more I missed working on something that I truly enjoyed making. 

So, at the end of 2018 I set my goal to work with the development of game engines. This blog is my attempt to document interesting bits of my path to getting there, and any technical challenges that I find worthwile to write about.

In my efforts to properly learn what goes into building a game engine, I'm currently making my own, which you can check <a href="https://github.com/lggmonclar/GRUT">here.</a>
